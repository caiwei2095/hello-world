# hello-world
My first repo

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a ***README***, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. ***It also offers other common options such as a license file.***

**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

On GitHub, saved changes are called ***commits***. Each commit has an associated ***commit message***, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
