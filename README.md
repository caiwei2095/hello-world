# hello-world
My first repo

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a ***README***, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. ***It also offers other common options such as a license file.***

**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

On GitHub, saved changes are called ***commits***. Each commit has an associated ***commit message***, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a ***pull request***, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
