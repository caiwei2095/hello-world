# hello-world
My first repo

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a ***README***, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. ***It also offers other common options such as a license file.***

**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

On GitHub, saved changes are called ***commits***. Each commit has an associated ***commit message***, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a ***pull request***, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

# Understanding the GitHub flow

1. Create a branch

Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the `master` branch is always deployable.

2. Add commits

each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction.

Commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your changes and then displays them as commits once they're pushed to the server. By writing clear commit messages, you can make it easier for other people to follow along and provide feedback.

3. Open a Pull Request

You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work. 

Pull Requests are useful for contributing to open source projects and for managing changes to shared repositories. If you're using a Fork & Pull Model, Pull Requests provide a way to notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider. If you're using a Shared Repository Model, Pull Requests help start code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the master branch.
